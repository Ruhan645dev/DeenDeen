## 🧠 The "Research vs. Spiritual" Pivot
During development, I refactored the project from an "AI Spiritual Assistant" to an "Islamic Research AI." This was a deliberate architectural choice based on Islamic theology regarding the *Ruh* (soul). By positioning the AI as a data-research tool rather than a spiritual entity, DeepDeen maintains theological integrity while providing maximum utility.
